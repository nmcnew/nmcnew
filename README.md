# Introduction

Hi! My name is Nicholas McNew (@nmcnew). I'm currently a Technical Lead at @ResourceDataInc, meaning I'm in charge of a 
lot of different things. Some of my responsibilities include Application Analysis, Application Architecture, Software 
Development and Branch Technical Guidance. I've worked in the Software Industry in some capacity since my Junior year in
High School (2012). In that time I've interned with HP Inc, Idaho Digital Learning Academy, and Xunos Inc doing 
primarily backend work with .NET and Java. I've also worked as a Full Time Software Engineer with Thriftbooks, Visitpay,
R1 RCM and Resource Data Inc, at all doing C#/.NET, Vue and SQL Server to build backend services and Web applications.
