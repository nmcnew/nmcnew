# Introduction

Hi! My name is Nicholas McNew (@nmcnew). I'm currently a Technical Lead at @ResourceDataInc, meaning I'm in charge of a 
lot of different things. Some of my responsibilities include Application Analysis, Application Architecture, Software 
Development and Branch Technical Guidance. I've worked in the Software Industry in some capacity since my Junior year in
High School (2012). In that time I've interned with HP Inc, Idaho Digital Learning Academy, and Xunos Inc doing 
primarily backend work with .NET and Java. As an intern I built Libraries and Tools for handling EMMC duplication 
hardware, upgrading antiquated ADO.NET procedures with a suite of helper libraries to aid in "Screen" development on 
printers and small helper scripts here and there. I've also worked as a Full Time Software Engineer with Thriftbooks, 
Visitpay, R1 RCM and Resource Data Inc, at all doing C#/.NET, Vue and SQL Server to build backend services and Web 
applications. With them I've helped build Highly available and high throughput pricing systems, worked on systems 
observability tools through ElasticSearch, developed tooling and scripts that work with various online retailers
to enable listing and research, demo'd and developed data warehousing with Snowflake, helped build webapp frontend with
vue and knockout, and helped build application backends for use throughout our webapp.
